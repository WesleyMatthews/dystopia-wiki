As Americans dug deeper into the Earth to find more of this mineral, explosions started occurring. Ignoring the dangers because of their greed, the Americans continued to mine false jadeite until 2070 AD, where a chain of explosions near the Earth’s core split the Earth into large chunks."},{"type":"text","content":"Everyone currently on the ground was killed, due to the explosions and rising temperatures. The ocean water was immediately sent into space, freezing into large asteroids made of ice. Americans lucky enough to be in an aircraft managed to survive and land on what remained of America, separated from the other chunks of the world with no communication between them."},{"type":"text","content":"Ten years later, in 2080 AD, the Americans started a <a href=\"./?page=classsystem\" target=\"_blank\">class system</a> amongst the million of them that remained. Wealthier individuals formed the upper class, leaving the middle and lower classes for the poorer individuals. The wealthy took leadership positions and formed a group called the “<a href=\"./?page=roger\" target=\"_blank\">Traditionalists</a>,” seeking to live as they had before the Apocalypse and oppress those beneath them. One traditionalist started the “<a href=\"./?page=frenchfry\" target=\"_blank\">Revolutionists</a>” in 2100 AD as an attempt to fight the oppression. The Revolutionists continue to rebel against The Traditionalists in a fight for an equal society."}]}
