{"title":"Class System","sections":[{"type":"text","content":"The American class system was started in 2080 AD, comprising of the upper, middle, and lower classes. Upper class residents formed the “<a href=\"./?page=roger\" target=\"_blank\">Traditionalists</a>,” seeking to live as they had before the Apocalypse. The group was created to suppress the middle and lower classes, showing the lack of respect and selflessness in the upper class. As leaders of the system, the upper class citizens are not nearly as restricted as the lower class, and typically have freedom in what they choose to do. Additionally, they are identified by their names, rather than an ID number."},{"type":"text","content":"Middle and lower class individuals are identified by their ID numbers, as the first step the Traditionalists took in suppression. The middle class was given basic salary jobs to “give them purpose” and prevent them from learning and being creative. <a href=\"./?page=wisdom\" target=\"_blank\">Robots</a> were designed to keep the middle and lower classes in check, although the middle class generally had more freedom than the lower class."},{"type":"text","content":"The lower class was the most suppressed, and the most driven to join the “<a href=\"./?page=frenchfry\" target=\"_blank\">Revolutionists</a>” with the hope of becoming important to society. Residents of this class were heavily brainwashed by the upper class to almost serve as robots, often given manual labor jobs. These jobs were targeted towards generating energy and collecting resources for the upper class. Interaction with the other classes was largely restricted for the lower class, and they were not allowed to use advanced technology or be educated."}]}
